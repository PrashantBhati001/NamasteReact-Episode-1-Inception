    <!-- 1.The order in which these scripts are mentioned matters,for example if you  move the last script to the top you will get 
    error.
    2.If something is already written inside the div with  id as root ,then that will get repplaced with what the react is 
    rendering in App.js
    3.whatever is there inside the div with id as root that only will be rendered ,what is above and below that will not be 
    affected. -->

        <!--<h1>Hello World</h1>-->

    </div>
    <!-- <script>
        const heading=document.createElement("h1")
        heading.innerHTML="Hello World from javascript"
        const element=document.getElementById("root")
        element.appendChild(heading)


    The code which we have written till now does not have react.To include react we have to include 
    it using the CDN react links.

    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js"></script>
    <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>

    <!-- Here there are two files react.development.js and react.dom.development.js which we are including in our project 
         The react.development.js contains the core code of react while the other files contains the code for react-dom.The question
         is why two files.The second file is needed because the react is needed for mobile for react native and similarly for other cases.
